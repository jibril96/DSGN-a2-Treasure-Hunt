## Call To Action Critique

On the company webpage, https://www.sportchek.ca/, the big ad picture calls to action. it is big enough that it is hard not to notice it once a customer visits the website. If you look at the ad photo it is clear what they are advertising. In big letters on the left it says, “Hit the Gym in Style…”, with a picture of people working out in a gym with cool gym clothes and shoes on the right. On the right bottom corner “shop now” button. This ad grabs your attention immediately, and this is done by the size of the ad image being larger than the rest of the ads and overwhelming you. It is the biggest on the webpage. The choice of typograph and unnecessary size call to action because it just looks like it was created without much thought or effort. And looking at the people in the gym and typography, it indicates that they probably do not have “stylish clothes” they claim they sale. In addition, SPORTCHEK website should probably take it easy with ads and pop ads.
